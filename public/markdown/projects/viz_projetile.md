# Projectile Motion Simulator

* [live demo](https://jinsanity07git.github.io/blog/files/trim_Functions.html)

A light weight simulator of projectile motion, written in d3 JS and HTML.
It uses a quiz of Projectile Motion in a Dynamics class to generate the trajectory of the projectile.
Other than solving the equations analytically, this project allows students to experiment with the parameters of the problem and observe the trajectory of the projectile.
