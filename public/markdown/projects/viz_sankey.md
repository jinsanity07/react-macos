The Sankey Chart is a visual representation of data flow or relationships within the TDM23 Macros, illustrating how data or processes move from one step to another. It features nodes representing different processes or steps, and links that show the connections and flow between these nodes. The Sankey chart's interactive and color-coded design makes it a powerful tool for visualizing and understanding the complex data flows within the TDM23 model, enhancing user comprehension and navigation.

* Color-Coded Nodes: Nodes are color-coded based on their category, enhancing visual differentiation and making it easier to identify different parts of the workflow.

* Interactive Nodes and Links: Hover over nodes and links to see additional information through tooltips. Right-click on nodes to access a context menu with options such as "Lock tracing," "View Purpose," "Go to documentation," and "Search in Repo."

* Highlight Connected Nodes: Selecting a node will highlight it along with its connected nodes, helping users trace the data flow and understand the relationships within the model.

* Search Functionality: Use the search functionality to find specific nodes and highlight them within the chart. The search results can open a modal displaying relevant documentation for the selected node.
